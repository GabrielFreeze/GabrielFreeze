I am a 21-year old student curently pursuing an bachelor degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Malta. I'm currently working on my thesis called "Using Machine Learning to investigate Potential Image Bias in News Articles". It consists of developing new methods that utilise state-of-the-art AI models to detect image-text discrepancies in newspaper articles. I have been coding since the age of 12 and have previously undertaken a data-scientist internship with [Harbor Solutions](https://www.harboursolutions.com.mt/about).
