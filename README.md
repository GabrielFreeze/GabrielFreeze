I am a 21-year old student curently pursuing a masters in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Malta. I'm currently working on a research project called "NBxAI". It consists of developing new methods that utilise state-of-the-art AI models to detect media bias in newspaper articles. I have been coding since the age of 12 and have previously worked as a data-scientist with [Harbor Solutions](https://www.harboursolutions.com.mt/about), and [ClearVue](https://clearvue.business/).
